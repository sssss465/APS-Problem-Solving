\section{Problem Description}

Provide a brief description for the problem.
Please clearly state the range of variables.
Describe your idea precisely and concisely.
Avoid ambiguity.
For example,

Given an array with $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) integers, find the maximum value among the integers.
Integers in the array are no larger than $10^9$ in their absolute values.


\section{Solutions}

Describe your intended solution(s) to this problem and its(their) time complexity.
For example,

\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform a linear scan to find the maximum value.
Time complexity is $O(n)$.
    \item Use divide-and-conquer to split the array into two equal halves. Find the maximum in each half and take the larger among the two halves during a merge. Time complexity is $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(1) = O(n)$. (an overkill and awkward solution).
\end{itemize}


\section{Anti-Solutions}

Describe some anti-solution(s) that people may try and briefly explain why they will fail.
For example,

\begin{itemize}
    \item A WA solution may initialize the answer to zero, and is thus unable to find a negative maximum.
    \item An RTE solution may have off-by-one error. (This is only an example! Try to find a more meaningful anti-solution.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Case Design}

Provide a plan for test case generation.
For example,

\begin{itemize}
    \item Three cases are generated randomly
    \item One case contains only negative numbers
    \item One case contains only zeroes
\end{itemize}

A total of $5$ secret cases will be generated.
